# Join our Network

There is strength in numbers! The more cameras included in the project, the stronger the data becomes. By becoming a participant, you are not only supporting scientific research but also providing data that can be used to save lives. The team will work with you to determine how we can highlight your contributions, by adding logos to our website or helping you develop custom alerts you can send out based on the data.  

### I have a camera I would like to integrate into the network to share my data.

#### How to Share Data?

Your video files can be uploaded into WebCOOS though one the following methods:

1. Upload standardized video files to WebCOOS regularly through an API (ftp, S3, etc.), OR
2. Provide WebCOOS access to video footage files that we can download periodically (http, ftp, S3, etc), OR
3. Upload files via a website (for one-time or small footage)

Data Sharing Requirement:

> Metadata Profile: In order to catalog and share the files, a robust metadata record will be created to describe the data.

Please fill out our [sign up form](/sign-up).

#### High Level Data Requirements

Sharing your video feed is an integral part of the WebCOOS project. In order to properly incorporate your data
into the project network, we need to ensure the following high level data requirements.

- Access to streaming video feed via iframe or other methods (optional)
- Access to video files that SECOORA can download and make available for standardized access, analysis and discovery
- Non-proprietary video formats (h.264/h.265 mp4, not something like apple pro-res 422).
- Data sharing agreement that the video data can be used and distributed for research and outreach purposes.

Once the data is incorporated into the WebCOOS network, it will be made available publicly through the
WebCOOS data portal to support the development of tools for image analysis and rip current detection.

### I would like to work with the project team to purchase and install a camera.

E-mail the project team! We are more than happy to share additional information about the project and provide you with the details on how you can get involved.
