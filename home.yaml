            Web cameras are a low cost coastal observing platform transforming how environmental
            monitoring is conducted. Web camera data has demonstrated value to address significant
            gaps in the nation's ability to monitor and accurately forecast various weather, ocean,
            ecological and public health hazards.  This project, Webcam Coastal Observation System
            (WebCOOS), promotes low cost webcams to:

              NOAA released a new operational rip current model that will improve beach safety
              through sophisticated rip current forecasts. NOAA plans to validate the model using
              shoreline footage from SECOORA's Webcam Coastal Observation System (WebCOOS) network.
